<details>
  <summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold"> What is a Bamboo agent?</summary><br>
A Bamboo agent is a service that allows to run job builds. There are different types of agents: remote, shared, local and elastic agents. For more information on agents, refer to <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/agents-and-capabilities-289277114.html">Agents and Capabilities on Atlassian.</a>
</details>
<br>
<details>
  <summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Can I use a Remote agent?</summary><br>
A <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/confeval/development-tools-evaluator-resources/bamboo/bamboo-remote-agents-and-local-agents">Remote agent</a> requires hosting, agent installation and/or VPN installation (if required). Registration of Remote agent is subjected to approval by SHIP-HATS team. Please send a service request via SHIP-HATS service desk for registration of Remote agent.
</details>
<br>
<details>
  <summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">When does my project require a Dedicated Remote agent?</summary><br>
If your build job needs to connect back to your own resources or run parallel job, you can consider adding a Dedicated Remote agent.For more information, refer to <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/dedicating-an-agent-629015108.html">dedicating an agent</a>.
</details>

<br>

<details>
  <summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">What is the requirement for Remote agents?</summary>

Agency must ensure the Remote agents are clean and secure before SHIP-HATS approves the registration with Bamboo server.

To setup Remote Bamboo agents, refer to the [Install Remote Agent](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-documentation/#/bamboo-overview?id=install-remote-agent) documentation.

To ensure that Remote agents are clean and secure, refer to <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/securing-your-remote-agents-289277197.html">securing your Remote agents</a>. This page is on SHIP-HATS confluence. Please log in to the account to access.

<details>
  <summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">What is a Shared Elastic agent?</summary>

<small>
A Shared Elastic agent is an on-demand Windows or Linux agent launched by Bamboo within SHIP's network to execute pipeline tasks. To leverage on elastic agent, Agency must specify the required capabilities and SHIP-HATS team will assign an agent that matches the required capabilities, if available.
</small>

<small>SHIP-HATS does not offer Mac OS agent as of now.</small>

<small>For more information on specifying required capabilities, refer to [Register a Remote Agent](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-documentation/#/bamboo-overview?id=register-remote-agent).</small>

</details>
<br>
<details>
  <summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Which OS is available for the shared elastic agent?</summary><br>
  Though MS Windows and Linux support, we recommend Linux as MS Window agents are quite heavy and would utilise a hefty load of Shared agent hours. We recommend the Agency subscribe to Remote agent if they choose MS Window agents.
