  <summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">While onboarding to Microsoft Intune, I get an error message, "Could not download the identity profile from the Encrypted Profile Service. The credentials within the Device Enrolment profile may have expired."</summary>

One of the possible reasons could be that your device was earlier onboarded to Microsoft Intune by a different user and was not offboarded properly during the pre-onboarding steps.

To confirm if that is the case, [create a support request][raise-support-request] with your device serial number.

The SEED team can verify if your device was previously enrolled to Microsoft Intune under a different user. If this is confirmed, choose on the following to offboard it from Microsoft Intune and then retry onboarding your device to SEED.

-   If you are a Windows user, refer to [SEED offboarding steps][seed-offboarding-steps].

-   If you are a macOS user, go to **System Preferences** and locate the old Management Profile. Refer to [SEED offboarding steps][seed-offboarding-steps].
