BAU continues as usual during migration. However, for a specific window during code migration, you will not be able to push any new code changes.

Though the overall migration may take 6-12 weeks, the actual duration for which you will be requested to pause code push varies based on your code volume and may range from a few hours to a couple of days.

You can also choose to dedicate a few systems/servers/developers to continue to code while a smaller team focuses on migration. In this scenario, after the code migration is complete, you will need to manually push the code changes done on/by your dedicated systems/servers/developers during the code migration window.
